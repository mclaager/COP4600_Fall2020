# COP4600_Fall2020
This contains any work that was done for UCF's Operating Systems Class (COP4600) for Fall 2020.

The most notable project from this class was the MyShell (/mysh) project, where the goal was to implement a Unix shell using C.
The code also contains some features that were considered to be extra, such as 'repeat' and 'exterminateAll'.
